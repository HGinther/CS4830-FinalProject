# Phi Sigma Pi National Honor Fraternity
## CS-4380 Final Project (Spring 2018)
* Andrew Pizzullo
* Cody Mcilvaine
* James Grady
* Hunter Ginther

## Introduction:
> Discuss the application domain, your client, the data, and any potential for product commercialization. Also include the URL for your project as well as sample (working) usernames and passwords for each type of user in your system.

Our group has been tasked with creating a functioning website to easily access and manipulate data for the Mizzou chapter of Phi Sigma Pi National Honor Fraternity. Currently, many different tools are being used by the fraternity such as OrgSync, Facebook, Google Docs, and random Excel sheets. Hunter has gathered all the necessary attributes we need to create dummy data for the fraternity since we will need to keep the actual fraternity member data private.

**URL:** [https://web.dsa.missouri.edu/~s18group03/](https://web.dsa.missouri.edu/~s18group03/index.php)

**Sample Credentials:**

## ERD:
> Must include an ERD in any type of notation (Chen, Crowâ€™s Foot notation, or other variants). You should explain all constraints and provide DDL for all tables.

### ERD table connections:
* Member contact info and address are both one to one with the member table as all members only need one entry in each of these tables. The emergencyContact table is the same.
* The member table references the member status table which is filled with the different types of members(active, inactive, nationally inactive, or alumni). One member status can be references to multiple members.
* familyTree_roster is a one to many with the member table because it will reference many members for each family. It also has a family_id referenced from the family table.
* Each member is referenced to one class_roster which references a specific class.
* Each member can attend multiple events with each event being a difference point type. Event_attendence is used to mark which events a member has gone to.
* Each chair position can make many events, thus the one to many between chair position and the events table.
* Each chair position has the opportunity to create a budget_register with a reference to a budget_item_id.
* Each member can have multiple merch_orders with each merch_order having a reference to a specific piece of merchandise from the merch table.
* Each member has to have member_dues and the option to set up a payment plan.
* A member can be a part of zero or many team_rosters which references one recSports_team. recSports_teams references one specific recSports.
* The votingResults table references one potential member from the potential_roster table.

## Normalization:
> Provide an in-depth discussion of normalization, dependency preservation, and de-normalization with respect to your project.

## Indexing:
> Give an in-depth discussion of indexing as it relates to your project
including how/why you created specific additional indexes. Provide the associated SQL statement for creation of those indexes.

### member Table (student_id, first_name, last_name)
```sql
CREATE INDEX member_name ON member (student_id, first_name, last_name);
```
> Most queries include the members table so creating this index will increase the speed of our queries.

### memberDues Table (amount_owed, amount_paid)
```sql
CREATE INDEX member_dues_amount ON memberDues (amount_owed, amount_paid);
```
> All members pay dues, so this index will increase the speed of those queries.

### budget Table (budget_item_id, semester, year)
```sql
CREATE INDEX budget_index ON budget (budget_item_id, item_type, semester, year);
```
> This table can get large over the years, so having an index on it is necessary for the long run.

### Potential_roster Table (student_id, first_name, last_name)
```sql
CREATE INDEX potential_roster_name ON potential_roster (student_id, first_name, last_name);
```
> This table can be large during the beginning of the semester so it is important to have an index on this table.


## Optimization and Tuning:
> Discuss the topics covered in class, specifically how they impacted the design of your final project.

## Security setting:
> Discuss the topics covered in class, specifically how they impacted your final project (e.g. any views you created for your project, including the SQL statement used to create the view; discretionary access control setting, etc.).

We used mandatory access control on the front end for our application. Once users login with their credentials, they will have access to every page they should have. We control this through the use of a session variable that is assigned to each user upon login. Every member will be shown the main dashboard page and then members who have positions will have a separate page they can access that is particular to their function. For example, the Fellowship Chair will have access to a form page where they can create Fellowship Events. The backend does not really deal with this as it is really only concerned with things such as invalid form inputs and SQL injection since much of the code is built into the front end. We did not need to create any views as different queries were made in combination with teh mandatory access control security system to display and access proper data. As far as handling the input on these forms, checks are made to make sure all the fields are filled out and are the proper data type. We also check to make sure there is no duplicate data so we make sure the same event name has not already been created for the same semester and year. These considerations had a huge impact on the delivery of our final project. We kept security in our thoughts first before every move as we know how crucial that is to any kind of application that will be holding sensitive user data. Not only did the data need to be protected from the world in terms of SQL injection, but it also needed to be protected within the chapter since some information is vital to limit to certain positions. If we had to put a number to it, we think close to 20% of our time went into security measures.

## Other topics:
> If you included any other database-related items in your project (triggers, PL/SQL, SparkQL, etc.), you should provide codes and discuss their use.

### Triggers:

#### dues_paymentPlan table
* Trigger: When last_amount_paid updated -> update amount_paid in memberDues
    * amount_paid = (OLD)amount_paid + (NEW)last_amount_paid

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS dues_paymentPlan_payment ON dues_paymentPlan;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS payment_made();
```
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION payment_made()
 RETURNS trigger AS
$$
BEGIN
    IF NEW.last_amount_paid IS NOT NULL
    THEN
        UPDATE memberDues
        SET amount_paid = amount_paid + NEW.last_amount_paid
        WHERE memberDues.dues_id = OLD.dues_id;

    END IF;

    IF OLD.last_payment_date = NEW.last_payment_date OR NEW.last_payment_date IS NULL
    THEN
        UPDATE dues_paymentPlan
        SET last_payment_date = current_date
        WHERE dues_paymentPlan.dues_id = OLD.dues_id;

    END IF;

    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER dues_paymentPlan_payment
  AFTER UPDATE OF last_amount_paid
  ON dues_paymentPlan
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE payment_made();
```

#### events table
* Trigger: When point_type is updated event_attendance should be updated
    * events.point_type = event_attendance.point_type
    * or memberPoint_associative

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS event_point_type_update ON events;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS event_type_update();
```
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION event_type_update()
 RETURNS trigger AS
$$
BEGIN
    UPDATE event_attendance
    SET point_type = NEW.point_type
    WHERE event_id = OLD.event_id;

    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER event_point_type_update
  AFTER UPDATE OF point_type
  ON events
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE event_type_update();
```

#### chairPosition Update on student ID
* create new archive chairPosition Table
* when student_id is updated create new entry in archive table and then update student_id

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS archive_chairPosition ON chairPosition;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS position_archive();
```
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION position_archive()
 RETURNS trigger AS
$$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO archive_chairPosition(position_id,student_id,year) VALUES
        (
            OLD.position_id,
            OLD.student_id,
            date_part('year',current_date)
        );

    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER archive_chairPosition
  AFTER UPDATE OF student_id
  ON chairPosition
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE position_archive();
